						<p>Elana (Lana) Duffy obtained a Masters in Engineering from Cornell, working in civil engineering with a major firm for a year before deciding something was missing. She enlisted in the US Army and subsequently served for nearly a decade as a human intelligence collector, interrogator, and investigator.

After coming face-to-face with an improvised explosive device in Iraq, Lana was medically retired from the Army in 2012 as a Sergeant First Class with a Purple Heart and a few other awards. She returned to New York, near where she'd grown up, and dusted off her degrees to start two businesses: www.presenttensellc.com, a content creation and ghostwriting firm, and www.pathfinder,vet, a "Yelp for Veteran resources" platform intent on improving the community through sharing experiences Veterans and the supporting community have with local organizations and services.
