<h4>The Brooklyn Tech Triangle</h4>

<p>If you are at one of our BE.IN partner institutions, you are likely based in and around what is increasingly known as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle - DUMBO, Downtown Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  Here’s a link to the <a href="http://brooklyntechtriangle.com" target="_blank">Brooklyn Tech Triangle website</a>.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Tech Triangle has become a magnet for the world’s pioneering, energetic, and creative entrepreneurs and has emerged as the City’s largest cluster of tech activity outside of Manhattan, with nearly 10% of the sector calling this area home.</p>

<h4>The Brooklyn Navy Yard</h4>
<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard is a 300-acre industrial park on the Brooklyn waterfront. Once the site of one of the nation’s most storied naval shipbuilding facilities, it is now home to over 330 industrial businesses employing nearly 7,000 people.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard is run by the not-for-profit corporation Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation (BNYDC). Through investments in new green buildings and infrastructure, the Yard has become a national model for sustainable urban industrial parks and home to modern manufacturers that are tech-driven and socially responsible.

<h4>A word on Title IX</h4>
<p>Title IX is important federal regulation and has a major impact on faculty and staff. The law while broad has a major focus on equity and sexual assault/misconduct.  The Office of Civil Rights has increased its monitoring, enforcement, and regulation. Faculty and staff need to be aware of their role and responsibility in abiding by and adhering of the law.</p>
