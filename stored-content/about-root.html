<p>What happens when you have a booming college town located in the heart of New York City’s third largest business district – and one of its strongest hubs for technology and innovation? The opportunities are endless. The Brooklyn Education Innovation Network (BE.IN) works tirelessly to create connections and cooperation among member institutions, students, and Brooklyn businesses.</p>

<h4>The mission of BE.IN</h4>
<p>Founded in 2014 by the <a href="http://downtownbrooklyn.com">Downtown Brooklyn Partnership</a>, with support from the City of New York, BE.IN’s mission is to foster cooperation among member institutions to broaden and enrich academic programs, encourage economies of scale through shared services, expand and encourage community service activities, and fuel economic growth by being a magnet to draw the best students and faculty to study, explore, live, intern, and work in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>BE.IN also works to create a sense of community among the over 11,000 faculty and staff of our ten member organizations, connect the area’s 66,000 college students to internships and jobs, and help local businesses source the best talent to fill internship and graduate spots right in their own backyard – Brooklyn.
