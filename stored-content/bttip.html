<h4>Why would I be interested in BTTIP?</h4>

<p>BTTIP is exciting for City Tech students who want to be a part of the booming tech and media movement happening here in Brooklyn. Many of the placements take place in what is called the <a href="http://brooklyntechtriangle.com" target="_blank">Brooklyn Tech Triangle</a>: DUMBO, Downtown Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Brooklyn Tech Triangle is a magnet for the world’s pioneering, energetic, and creative entrepreneurs and has become New York City’s largest cluster of tech activity outside of Manhattan – and only growing in size.</p>

<p>New startups and businesses are calling Brooklyn home from day one, while established outside firms are searching for ways to become a part of the Brooklyn tech scene. DUMBO is bursting with digital companies. The Brooklyn Navy Yard has dozens of makers, artisans, and other firms driven by technology. Downtown Brooklyn has 60,000 college students—and a supportive business community ready to join the mix.</p>

<h4>Who’s behind this?</h4>
<p>Several organizations collaborate to bring BTTIP to life.  Find out more about each of the organizations below: </p>
